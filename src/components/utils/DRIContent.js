      At 5th and Main
      Gonna catch the bus
      Or take the train
      We'll steal or find
      Or borrow cash
      And we'll be there
      Ready to thrash
      The band kickes in
      They begin to rage
      No-man's land
      In front of the stage
      Poseurs in the bathroom
      Still looking at their hair
      Thrashers in the foreground
      Doing what they dare
      In the pit
      Thrashing and slamming
      Like hell in the pit
      Tomorrow they know
      May not come
      Banging and moshing
      Like they don't give a shit
      To the rapid beat
      Of the drum
      A boot to your forehead
      A knee in your face
      Your nose and lips
      Start to bleed
      Like a wild Indian
      From outer space
      Drunk and
      High on weed
      Guitar seems so fucking loud
      People walking on the crowd
      Diving off the P.A. stacks
      Breaking ankles, necks and backs
      Then the circle begins
      In the thrashing pit
      Fist are flying
      People getting hit
      Tooth chippers left and right
      Skinheads in another fight
      Banging heads and broken jaws
      Because there are no laws
      In the pit
      Then you start thrashing
      Like never before
      Stagediving, headwalking like mad
      Doing your thing
      All over the floor
      The best time that you've ever had
      You are hurt all over
      But can't feel a thing
      Not until the next day
      Then you wake up
      Stiff as a board
      And the pain won't go away
      Another gig at 5th and Main
      We'll catch the bus
      Or take the train
      We'll steal or find
      Or borrow cash
      And we'll be there
      Ready to thrash
      In the pit`
