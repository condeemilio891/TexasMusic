      Life without darlin' is a solid mess
      Thinkin' bout you baby gives me such a thrill
      I gotta have you baby, can't get my fill
      I love you baby and I know just what to do
      I still remember and let it be said
      The way you make me feel take a fool to forget
      I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head
      And what you do little baby ain't over it yet
      Every time I see you make me feel so fine
      Heart beatin' crazy, my blood run wild
      Lovin' makes me feel like a might mighty man
      Love me baby aint i your man
      I'm a love struck baby
      Yeah I'm a love struck baby
      You got me love struck baby
      And I know just what to do
      Sparks start flyin' every time we meet
      Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet
      Your kisses trip me up they're so dog gone sweet
      Ya know baby you can't be beat
      I'm a love struck baby
      Yeah I'm a love struck baby
      You got me love struck baby
      And I know just what to do`

      There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge
      Thank God it never found me would have been the end
      Walkin' the tightrope, steppin' on my friends
      Walkin' the tightrope, it was a shame and a sin
      Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right
      Walkin' the tightrope both day and night
      Lookin' back in front of me, the mirror's a grin
      Through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend
      We've all had our problems, that's the way life is
      My heart goes out to others, who are there to make amends?
      We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right
      Walkin' the tightrope, every day and every night
      Walkin' the tightrope, bring it all around
      Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
      Walkin' the tightrope, stretched around the world
      Walkin' the tightrope, save the boys and girls
      Walkin' the tightrope, let's make it right
      Walkin' the tightrope, do it, do it tonight
      Walkin' the tightrope`
