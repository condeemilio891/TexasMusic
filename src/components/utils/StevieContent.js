      I love you baby and I know just what to do
      I still remember and let it be said
      The way you make me feel take a fool to forget
      I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head
      And what you do little baby ain't over it yet
      Every time I see you make me feel so fine
      Heart beatin' crazy, my blood run wild
      Lovin' makes me feel like a might mighty man
      Love me baby aint i your man
      I'm a love struck baby
      Yeah I'm a love struck baby
      You got me love struck baby
      And I know just what to do
