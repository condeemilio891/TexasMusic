      Life without darlin' is a solid mess
      Thinkin' bout you baby gives me such a thrill
      I gotta have you baby, can't get my fill
      I love you baby and I know just what to do
      I still remember and let it be said
      The way you make me feel take a fool to forget
      I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head
      And what you do little baby ain't over it yet
      Every time I see you make me feel so fine
      Heart beatin' crazy, my blood run wild
      Lovin' makes me feel like a might mighty man
      Love me baby aint i your man
      I'm a love struck baby
      Yeah I'm a love struck baby
      You got me love struck baby
      And I know just what to do
      Sparks start flyin' every time we meet
      Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet
      Your kisses trip me up they're so dog gone sweet
      Ya know baby you can't be beat
      I'm a love struck baby
      Yeah I'm a love struck baby
      You got me love struck baby
      And I know just what to do`
