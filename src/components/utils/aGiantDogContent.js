      On this roller coaster ride
      Stuck up at the top
      An ugly stranger by your side
      You're hangin' upside down
      So high above the ground, whoa oh oh
      Finally lost your mind
      On this roller coaster ride
      Flushing to your head
      Your desperate and alternate wife
      You're hangin' upside down
      So high above the ground, whoa oh oh
      Afraid of lookin' down
      Afraid of falling out, whoa oh oh
      When I was young
      I had a good time
      I was too scared to go outside
      And so I stayed in
      With my tin soldiers
      I'm all alone now
      Now that I'm older
      Finally lost your mind
      Finally lost your mind
      Finally lost your mind
      Finally lost your mind, whoa oh oh
      When I was Young
      When I was Young
      When I was Young
      When I was Young`

      Nothing in my nature tells me not to do bad things
      I know that I really should be good tonight
      There's a kind of satisfaction that destruction brings
      Consequences never could convince me that I should do right
      
      [Chorus]
      I'll come crashing
      I'll come crashing
      I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that
      I built
      
      
      [Verse 2]
      Mama always told me I should have sense of pride
      Daddy always told me how to be a straight up guy
      Always tell the truth and never have a thing to hide
      But I'm gonna shoot the moon and watch it fall from the sky
      
      [Chorus]
      I'll come crashing!
      I'll come crashing!
      I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that
      I built
      Nothing matches the passion and thrill of desired overkills
      
      [Chorus]
      I'll come crashing!
      I'll come crashing!
      I'll come crashing down in the ash of a fire that

      I got a wallet
      Looking slim, on a whim, I went out last night
      Spent all my money
      On some bait for a date but she didn't bite

      I can sleep when I am dead
      All my friends said I look tired

      I'm dying

      I see your daughter
      Lose control on a pole at the titty bar
      I could've bought her
      But the junk in her trunk didn't make me hard
