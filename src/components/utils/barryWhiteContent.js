      Too much of anything is not good for you, baby
      But, I don't know about that

      Oh no, babe
      Tell me
      What can I say?
      What am I gonna do?
      How should I feel when everything is you?
      What kind of love is this that you're givin' me?
      Is it in your kiss or just because you're sweet?
      Girl, all I know
      Is every time you're here

Only a fool maybe takes things for granted

If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way... You are...
Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are
Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care
I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are.
I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you.
I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are.I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are.
