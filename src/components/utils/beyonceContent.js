      Are you ready to be entertained?
      Yes!
      It's so crazy right now
      Most incredibly, it's ya girl, B
      It's your boy, young
      (You ready?)

      1, 2, 3, 4!
      Yeah, history in the making
      Part two, it's so crazy right now
      I look and stare so deep in your eyes
      I touch on you more and more everytime
      When you leave I'm begging you not to go
      Call your name two or three times in a row
      Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
      How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
      Yeah, 'cause I still don't understand
      Just how your love can do what no one else can
      (Got me looking so crazy right now)
      (Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) Your love
      (Got me looking so crazy right now)
      (Your touch got me looking so crazy right now) Your touch
      (Got me hoping you'll page me right now) Hey!
      (Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now)
      (Looking so crazy, your love's)

      Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh, no, no
      When I talk to my friends so quietly
      Who he think he is?
      Look at what you did to me
      Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
      You are there, ain't nobody else to...
      (Sing it y'all!)
      (It's the way that you know what I thought I knew)
      The beat in my heart skips when I'm with you
      I still don't understand
      Just how your love can do what no one else can
      (Got me looking so crazy right now)
      (Your love's got me looking so crazy right now) So crazy!
      (Got me looking so crazy right now) Your love
      (Your touch got me looking so crazy right now) Hey-ey!

      Who do you think you are?
      Huh-huh-huh-huh
      Bless your soul
      You really think you're in control?
      Does that make me crazy?
      Does that make me crazy?
      Does that make me crazy?
      Possibly!
      Yeah!
      (Got me looking so crazy, my baby) Oh-oh-oh

      (I've been playing myself, baby, I don't care) Yea-eah!
      'Cause your love's got the best of me
      And, baby, you're making a fool of me

      And keep talking that mess, that's fine
      Could you walk and talk at the same time?
      And, it's my name that's on that Jag'
      So remove your bags, let me call you a cab
      Standing in the front yard
      Tellin' me how I'm such a fool
      Talkin' 'bout, how I'll never ever find a man like you
      You got me twisted

      Baby, I won't shed a tear for you
      I won't lose a wink of sleep
      'Cause the truth of the matter is

      Up in the club, we just broke up
      I'm doing my own little thing
      Decided to dip and now you wanna trip
      Cause another brother noticed me
      I'm up on him, he up on me
      Don't pay him any attention
      Just cried my tears, for three good years
      Ya can't be mad at me

      Here's a man that makes me then takes me
      And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
