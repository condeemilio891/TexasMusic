      [Chorus]
      Nigga thinkin' that I love him (Nah)
      I don't even want him, he getting played, played (Bitch)
      Everything on fleek
      My lace and my hair, my nails is laid, laid (Ayy)
      Went back for the bag
      Got the sack right, now I'm like "Ayy, ayy" (Ayy)
      Hop inside the coupe
      All gas, no brakes, we do the race, race (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
      
      [Verse]
      Nigga, you last 'cause you chasin' these hoes
      Went all the way in, I'm in love with the rolls
      Run up a sack just to shit on you hoes
      Got me a bag, now designer my clothes
      Steppin' on neck and designer my toes
      Your money be funny, you ain't with the bros (Nah)
      Hop in the coupe, hit a loop in the Rolls (Skrrt)
      Look at my neck and my wrist, it's on froze
      Hop on the social, I'm doin' the most (Ayy)
      Where is my haters? They hidin' and ghost (Ayy)
      Came to your city, I'm running your shit
      Came to my city, you runnin' and shit (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
      These niggas, they ain't about shit
      Hatin' on me like a bitch
      Turn up a notch in this bitch
      Just blew a bag with the sis (Ayy)
      Hop on the Gram, take a pic (Yeah, ayy)
      These pussies, they all on my dick
      Wanna rock with me and shit
      Lotta knots on me and shit
      Lotta boppers in this bitch (Lotta boppers in this bitch)
      Got a problem, better hit
      Talkin' shit, better quit
      Say you in love with my lips
      We fuckin', you grabbin' my hips, ayy, ayy
      Get up, get back to the money
      Get rid of the profit and give me some money, ayy
      
      [Chorus]
      Nigga thinkin' that I love him (Nah)
      I don't even want him, he getting played, played (Bitch)
      Everything on fleek
      My lace and my hair, my nails is laid, laid (Ayy)
      Went back for the bag
      Got the sack right, now I'm like "Ayy, ayy" (Ayy)
      Hop inside the coupe
