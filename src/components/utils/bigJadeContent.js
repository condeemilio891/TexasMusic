      Bitch, I'm a boss, you a motherfuckin' bum
      I don't fuck with these hoes, these hoes be dumb
      Hop on a beat, used to do it for fun
      Beat a bitch up, don't need no gun
      Put the pussy on him, baby was done
      I throws it back, I ain't never gon' run
      It ain't no race 'cause I already won
      Big Miss Pussy, you hoes my son
      Bitch, I'm a boss, you a motherfuckin' bum

      It ain't no pressure 'bout none of these niggas
      I stay at the crib and I go get the figures
      Bitch, I'm phenomenal, I could do better
      My feet hit the pavement, I go get the cheddar
      Jade stopped stressin' and started getting thick
      When I post me a picture, they all on my dick
      Got me a play, I pull up with my bitch
      I cannot go in deep in case I wanna split
      I don't like drama, I gave 'em the boot
      Conversation over, told 'em I'm through
      Hop in the coupe when I ride to the booth
      When I pull up to the crib, no later than two
      Gotta compete with the old me
      Not with these bitches, that's what my lil' brother just told me
      I cannot settle, I know that I'm loud
      I cannot settle, I know I'm a star

      Hoes really wanna test me
      Now a bitch gon' check me

      Whether I'm in county or in Texas stressin' stuff on my probation
      Chasin' dreams and chasin' money, we ain't never livin' basic
      Watch my brother protest on the internet 'cause they was bein' racist
      Wearin' masks to drop a bag inside the store, that shit is crazy
      Man dead, he pinned him down like by his throat, that shit is crazy
      Lotta hoes ain't in they bag, they in they bed, these bitches lazy
      Gotta watch your circle, everybody ain't happy for you, niggas shady
      Moms think I'm blinded by the money, I see clearly now
      Got a couple visions I see clearly, need some business now
      Why nobody understand, gotta help, tryna understand
      Get it by any means necessary, never put your trust in a man
      Gotta put all your trust in God
      'Cause a lot of people, they be movin' fraud
      Jump off the porch and get out the yard
      Make sure your team be on one accord
      Stressin' lately, feel kinda down
      But my money up, so I ain't never down
      Don't give a fuck who don't come around
      Hated on me, they silent now
      I'm pullin' up with them bands
      Get off the plane and go party with friends
      We tryna get to them ends
      All my life, follow my mama 'cause been settin' trends
      Promise we gon' get it in
      Fam be on some fake shit
      Watch and learn and don't say shit
      Grind hard on some ape shit
      So I'm pullin' up on some late shit
      Whole team held me down, I don't know about yours
      So I hustle hard so my whole team can be in and out of them stores
      Hood rich and we flashy
      I'm NFO, so don't ask me
      Never Fall Off actually
      Boss niggas gon' harass me`
