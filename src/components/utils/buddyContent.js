      When you say goodbye
      Yes, that'll be the day
      When you make me cry
      You say you're gonna leave
      You know it's a lie
      'Cause that'll be the day
      When I die
      Well, you gave me all your loving
      And your turtle doving
      All your hugs and kisses
      And your money too
      You know you love me, baby
      Still you tell me maybe
      That someday well
      I'll be through
      Well, that'll be the day
      When you say goodbye
      Yes, that'll be the day
      When you make me cry
      You say you're gonna leave

      When you make me cry
      You say you're gonna leave
      You know it's a lie
      Cause that'll be the day
      When I die, well
      When Cupid shot his dart
      He shot it at your heart
      So if we ever part
      Then I'll leave you
      You sit and hold me
      And you tell me boldly
      That someday
      Well, I'll be through
      Well, that'll be the day
      When you say goodbye
      Yes, that'll be the day
      When you make me cry
      You say you're gonna leave
      You know it's a lie
      'Cause that'll be the day
      When I die
      Well, that'll be the day, oh-oh
      That'll be the day, oh-oh
      That'll be the day, oh-oh
      That'll be the day`
