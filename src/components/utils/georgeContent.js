      content: `All my exes live in Texas
      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
      Rosanna's down in Texarkana
      Wanted me to push her broom
      Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
      She forgot I hung the moon
      And Allison's in Galveston
      Somehow lost her sanity
      And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
      Got the law looking for me
      All my exes live in Texas
      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      That's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
      Play it boys
      I remember that old Frio River
      Where I learned to swim
      But it brings to mind another time
      That I wore my welcome thin
      And by transcendental meditation
      I go there each night
      But I always come back to myself
      Long before daylight
      All my exes live in Texas (yes they do)
      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      Therefore I reside in Tennessee
      Some folks think I'm hidin'
      It's been rumored that I died
      But I'm alive and well in Tennessee`
