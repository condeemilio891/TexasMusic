      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
      Rosanna's down in Texarkana
      Wanted me to push her broom
      Sweet Eileen's in Abilene
      She forgot I hung the moon
      And Allison's in Galveston
      Somehow lost her sanity
      And Dimples who now lives in Temple's
      Got the law looking for me
      All my exes live in Texas
      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      That's why I hang my hat in Tennessee
      Play it boys
      I remember that old Frio River
      Where I learned to swim
      But it brings to mind another time
      That I wore my welcome thin
      And by transcendental meditation
      I go there each night
      But I always come back to myself
      Long before daylight
      All my exes live in Texas (yes they do)
      And Texas is a place I'd dearly love to be
      But all my exes live in Texas
      Therefore I reside in Tennessee
      Some folks think I'm hidin'
      It's been rumored that I died
      But I'm alive and well in Tennessee`

      Up from San Antone
      Everything that I got

      When that Sun is high
      In that Texas sky
      I'll be buckin' at the county fair
      Amarillo by mornin'
      Amarillo I'll be there
      They took my saddle in Houston
      Broke my leg in Santa Fe
      Lost my wife and a girlfriend
      Somewhere along the way
      But I'll be lookin' for eight
      When they pull that gate
      And I hope that
      Judge ain't blind
      Amarillo by mornin'
      Amarillo's on my mind
      Amarillo by mornin'
      Up from San Antone
      Everything that I got
      Is just what I've got on
      I ain't got a dime
      But what I've got is mine
      I ain't rich
      But Lord, I'm free
      Amarillo by mornin'
      Amarillo's where I'll be
      Amarillo by mornin'
      Amarillo's where I'll be`

      I wish u still wanted me
      He must have stolen some stars from the sky
      And gave them to u to wear in your eyes
      I've had my chances but I'll set you free
      And now I wonder, why I couldn't see
      You look so good in love

      U want him that's easy to see
      You look so good in love

      Now darling I've wasted a lot of years not seein' the real u
      But tonight your beauty is shinin' through
      And I never took the time to let you know
      So before he takes you away, please, let me say
      You look so good in love
      You want him that's easy to see
      You look so so good ya
