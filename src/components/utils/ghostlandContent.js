      content: `Been getting tired of my motor running
      Feeling overheated 'cause my life keeps coming
      My heart has been troubled by the speed of love
      Searching these streets for a soul committee
      Talking ideas of lust and pity
      The fables I've found have no place at home
      Well I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Yeah, I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Well, roll the dice, pay the price
      Dance with wolves in a pack of lies
      The blood we crave will drive us all insane
      Outer space, it's a lovely place
      A long lost love in a flower vase
      Laying on the floor shattered, battered, and bruised
      Well I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Yeah, I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Well I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Yeah, I need you, to want me, hold me, tell me the truth
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city
      Ain't no party in a sad sad city`

      About that time a caldilac comes bumbin down the street
      Hits his breaks and pops the trunk says this you got to see
      Ive go chains and diamond rings a tracks and lp's
      Do you like my merchandise says still that aint for me
      Just give me the beat
      Thats all i need
      Just give me the beat
      Thats all i need
      (Scream) night loss (bridge)
      He throws his cape around my back says kid just come with me
      You havent seen my stable yet got every kind of breed
      Step inside and meet the girls sheela and jolene
      Legs for days they go both ways still that aint for me
      Just give me the beat
      Thats all i need
      Just give me the beat
      Thats al i need`

      Movin' forward into outer space
      And I'm a mountain, I am disaster

      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
      You don't wanna just discover
      Lover, a strange kind of lover
      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
      You don't wanna just discover
      And this old habit, I will not have it
      Just takin' over like it has before
      And this position, it's on a mission
      To keep me movin', to keep me goin' on
      Lover, a strange kind of lover
      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
      You don't wanna just discover
      Lover, a strange kind of lover
      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
      You don't wanna just discover, lover
      So let your skin out and go and find out
      What is the matter around the river bend
      It is the question to the old answer
      Can you leave me with the one I love
      Lover, a strange kind of lover
      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
      You don't wanna just discover
      Lover, a strange kind of lover
      A different kind of lover
      The kind of lover
