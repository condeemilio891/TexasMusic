      That's what it is
      It's a country song, yeah, okay
      One, two, three, four
      One, two, three, four
      Busted flat in Baton Rouge, and headin' for the trains
      Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans
      Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained
      Took us all away to New Orleans
      I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
      And was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues
      With them windshield wipers slappin' time
      And Bobby clappin' hands, we finally sang up
      Every song that driver knew
      Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
      Nothin' ain't worth nothin', but it's free
      Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
      Feelin' good was good enough for me
      Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
      From the coalmines of Kentucky to the California sun
      Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
      Standin' right beside me Lord through everything I done
      Every night she kept me from the cold
      Then somewhere near Salinas lord, I let her slip away
      Lookin' for the home, I hope she'll find
      And I'd trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday
      Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine
      Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
      Nothin' left is all she left for me
      Feelin' good was easy Lord, when Bobby sang the blues
      Buddy, that was good enough for me
      Good enough for me and Bobby McGee
      La la la...
      Me and Bobby McGee
      La la la...
      Me and Bobby McGee
