      content: `I've cussed on a Sunday
      I've cheated and I've lied
      I've fallen down from grace
      A few too many times
      But I find holy redemption
      When I put this car in drive
      Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      When Hank brings the sermon
      And Cash leads the choir
      It gets my cold cold heart burning
      Hotter than a ring of fire
      When this wonderful world gets heavy
      And I need to find my escape
      I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
      'Til my sins wash away
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      Hey, can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      Yeah I guess that's my church`
