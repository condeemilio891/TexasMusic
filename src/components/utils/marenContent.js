      When I put this car in drive
      Roll the windows down and turn up the dial
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      When Hank brings the sermon
      And Cash leads the choir
      It gets my cold cold heart burning
      Hotter than a ring of fire
      When this wonderful world gets heavy
      And I need to find my escape
      I just keep the wheels rolling, radio scrolling
      'Til my sins wash away
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen
      Feels like the Holy Ghost running through ya
      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival
      Singing every single verse
      Yeah I guess that's my church
      Can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen

      Hey, can I get a hallelujah
      Can I get an amen

      When I play the highway FM
      I find my soul revival

      I can't love you anymore, I can't love you anymore
      I can't love you anymore than I do now
      You can try to talk me down but I can say without a doubt
      I can't love you anymore than I do now
      
      [Outro]
      You're the most that I've attempted
      Couldn't even put a dent in
      I can't love you anymore than I do now`

      Still runs good, built to last
      Moves like a hula girl on the dash
      She ain't made for practicality
      Yeah, I guess she's just like me
      
      [Pre-Chorus 1]
      It's Saturday night, about time to go
      Got my white leather jacket and a neon soul
      Once I turn on the radio, I'm ready to roll, r-ready to roll
      
      
      
      [Chorus]
      Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
      Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
      Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
      Call me old school, but hey
      I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
      I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
      
      [Verse 2]
      Pop the top down like a summer dream
      She's my teenage time machine
      Just keeps getting sweeter with age
      She's classic through any decade
      
      [Pre-Chorus 2]
      The suns in the sky, glitter on the seats
      You can try, but the Benz is hard to beat
      So, hey, if you want you can ride with me, r-ride with me
      
      [Chorus]
      Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
      Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
      Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
      Call me old school, but hey
      I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes
      I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes

      [Chorus]
      Feel like a hard-to-get starlet when I'm driving
      Turning every head, hell, I ain't even trying
      Got them Ray-Ban shades, pretty in pink
      Call me old school, but hey

      I'm a 90s baby in my 80s Mercedes`
