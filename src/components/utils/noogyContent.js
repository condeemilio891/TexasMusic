      At Grandma's house.
      Oh were all strung out.
      At Grandma's house.
      At Grandma's house.
      
      Yo at Grandma's house, the syringe is a hand me down.
      and the magnets dont stick, like used to on the fridge.
      When we still had TV dinners, stolen cable on the antennas.
      Saw my family on breaking news, from a mattress in the living room.
      That I shoulda thrown out right, first time it gave me lice.
      Now theres no electricity, and the bulbs been burnt cause they pookies.
      Food stamps dont get, no Sudafed, no Anahidris.
      But my cousin can be, ChefBoyardee, cookin speed with his dad's recipe.
      
      At Grandma's House
      Oh were all strung out
      At Grandma's House
      At Grandma's House
      
      Well Me, Grandpa, and the dawg, saw a kid get stabbed on the lawn.
      Witha screwdriver by the next door neighbor throwin up his set.
      And his girl's got 6 kids, from 5 dads and home is
      4 corners and door. When she aint gettin beat on the porch.
      Way back I dated that chick, now she's on dope or pregnant
      or both, no one knows, were all that child support goes.
      But her pupils meet the white of her eyes, under a million sneakers ona power line.
      So every night cops get called, for domestic assault, by my Grandma.
      
      Well I guess i'll call Aaron to skate, wait he caught that murder case.
      He's doin 4-0, no parole, sorta like my primo.
      Together me and him, useda laugh a little harder than
      ever before, I knew it he aint there no more.
      
      At Grandma's House
      Oh were all strung out
      At Grandma's House
