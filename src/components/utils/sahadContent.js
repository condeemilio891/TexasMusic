      I’m Mr. Big with my hand up on my hips
      I just wanna see the sun

      I’m here to have some Mai Tais on the beach
      (On the beach)
      Or in the club
      (In the club)
      I’m on a jet ski with James Franco and he tells me that I’m fun
      I know i’m fun
      (I know i’m fun)
      But I’m not for everyone
      And you’re not for everyone
      I’m still here to make a splash
      
      On that blue velvet
      You feel so good on my skin
      Take a leap over the edge
      
      On that blue velvet
      You feel so good on my tongue
      Every day sweet on the fuzz

      Woah
      I’m on the run
      
      Let me take you round the ocean
      I found an island off the keys
      Full of us and chimpanzees
      They wanna battle
      They have a king
      (what’s his name)
      I don’t go home without my cardboard
      When it’s done don’t make a scene
      Let’s cut the shit
      (Let’s cut the shit)
      We’re not that different you know
      No ones that different you know
      Lets take a dive
      On that blue velvet
      You feel so good on my eyes
      Take a deep breath and survive
      I’m on the run

      Woah

      (hey hey hey hey) x 16
      
      Where you running
      We’re gonna riot
      You can chase us but you can't identify us
      (ya ya ya ya)

      warmth in a cold world. Sahad refects that is hard to accept someones warmth as reality but it is reality.
      It is ok to let go of the cynical shell and and allow yourself to feel the warmth and love
      of a person even though one day that warmth may not be there anymore. Sahad encorages the listener not to waste their heart in the name
      of cynisism and
      nihilism as that is fear. Yes the world is cold, but we have each other so be brave and love.
