      I think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      Tried to move, but I lost my way
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      Stopped to watch my emotions sway
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      Knew the toll, but I would not pay
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      That you never know where the cards may lay
      Time to save the world
      Where in the world is all the time?
      So many things I still don't know
      So many times I've changed my mind
      Guess I was born to make mistakes
      But I ain't scared to take the weight
      So when I stumble off the path
      I know my heart will guide me back

      Tried to run, but I lost my way
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      Stopped to watch my emotions sway
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      Knew the toll, but I would not pay
      Didn't cha' know, didn't cha' know
      I said ya never know how the cards may lay
      Love is life and life is free
      Take a ride of life with me
      Free your mind and find your way
      There will be a brighter day
